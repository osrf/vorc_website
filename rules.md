# Competition Structure 

## Tasks
Competition tasks are divided into two levels:
* **Level 1**: Control and Perception Fundamentals
* **Level 2**: Control and Perception Integration

Level 1 tasks are designed to test fundamental control and perception capabilities 
in isolation, whereas level 2 tasks require multiple control and perception capabilities 
to be exercised in combination.

For a detailed description of competition tasks, please see the 
[VORC Competition and Task Descriptions]() document.

## Scoring
VORC scoring is inspired by the low-point system used in sailboat racing. Teams
receive a task rank for each task, and the final competition score is the sum
of all task ranks. Further details are available in the [VORC Competition and 
Task Descriptions]() document.

# Tech Guide
The [VORC Technical Guide]() describes elements of the competition that are common
across all tasks. These include:
* the robotic platform,
* propulsion,
* sensor configuration,
* runs and environment envelopes,
* the application programming interface (API), and
* instructions for submitting your code for the competition.
