# Goals

## Engage university-level teams from around the world with real problems in autonomy and maritime robotics.

## Stimulate learning and broaden exposure to robotic technologies.

## Introduce the challenges of autonomy faster with simulation. 

## Provide a venue and incentive for students of robotics to prototype and test innovative solutions.

Paragraph Style:

The Virtual Ocean Robotics Challenge (VORC) invites university-level teams from around the world to develop autonomous solutions to challenges in maritime robotics. Our mission is to facilitate education, stimulate learning and broaden exposure to robotic technologies.  

The competition will take place within a Gazebo-based simulation environment. Our intent is to increase participant facility with virtualization as a means to lower the cost and labor associated with testing algorithms for autonomy. Gains include an accelerated development cycle, and, for newer participants, a lower barrier of entry.

Describe the goal of the competition and target audience.

From VRX: 

The Virtual RobotX (VRX) competition is an international, university-level competition designed to broaden studentâ€™s exposure to autonomy and maritime robotic technologies. Student teams operate their vehicle in a Gazebo-based simulation environment built by Open Robotics and Naval Postgraduate School. Students are tasked to develop innovative solutions to ensure their virtual USV can perform prescribed tasks in this environment.
